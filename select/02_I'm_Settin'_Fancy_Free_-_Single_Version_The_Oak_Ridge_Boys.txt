I'm settin' fancy free, because she wants to go
She's tired of loving me, she told me so
I guess she don't know just how much she means to me
But along with all my dreams I'm settin' fancy-free

Yes I'm settin' free even though I love her still
She'd be no good to me if I held her against her will
Even though that girl she's the best part of my world
Along with all my dreams I'm settin' fancy-free

Oh lord you just don't know how it hurts to say goodbye
She did her best to stay I can't say she did not try
I just hope the road she takes leads back to me
So along with all my dreams I'm settin' fancy-free

Yes I'm srttin' fancy free even though I love her still
She'd be no good to me if I held her against her will
Even though that girl she's the best part of my world
Along with all my dreams I'm settin' fancy-free

Yes I'm settin' fancy free even though I love her still
She'd be no good to me if I held her against her will
Even though that girl she's the best part of my world
Along with all my dreams I'm settin' fancy-free

Yes I'm settin' fancy free even though I love her still
She'd be no good to me if I held her against her will
Even though that girl she's the best part of my world
Along with all my dreams I'm settin' fancy-free
