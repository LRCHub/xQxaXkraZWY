[00:10.00] I remember it all very well lookin' back
[00:12.62] It was the summer I turned eighteen
[00:15.39] We lived in a one room, rundown shack
[00:17.66] On the outskirts of New Orleans
[00:33.16] 
[00:20.52] We didn't have money for food or rent
[00:22.73] To say the least we were hard pressed
[00:25.55] Then mama spent every last penny we had
[00:27.90] To buy me a dancin' dress
[00:40.40] 
[00:30.01] Well, Mama washed and combed
[00:31.74] And curled my hair
[00:32.70] And she painted my eyes and lips
[00:35.34] Then I stepped into a satin dancin' dress
[00:37.72] That had a split on the side clean up to my hip
[00:41.47] It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
[00:45.51] Standin' back from the lookin' glass
[00:47.03] There stood a woman where a half grown kid had stood
[01:13.03] 
[00:50.32] She said "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"
[00:55.43] She said "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"
[01:24.93] 
[01:03.21] Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck
[01:06.55] Then she kissed my cheek
[01:08.18] And then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes
[01:11.60] As she started to speak
[01:13.48] She looked at our pitiful shack
[01:15.18] And then she looked at me
[01:16.35] And took a ragged breath
[01:18.14] She said "Your pa's runned off and I'm real sick
[01:20.89] And the baby's gonna starve to death"
[01:39.39] 
[01:23.64] She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
[01:26.41] "To thine own self be true"
[01:28.49] And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl
[01:30.85] Across the toe of my high heel shoe
[01:33.92] It sounded like somebody else that was talkin'
[01:36.22] Askin' "Mama what do I do?"
[01:38.44] She said "Just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy
[01:41.38] They'll be nice to you"
[01:52.88] 
[01:43.44] She said "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"
[01:49.08] "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"
[01:53.04] Lord forgive me for what I do
[01:56.34] But if you want out well it's up to you
[01:58.79] Now don't let me down now your mama's gonna move you uptown"
[02:28.79] 
[02:06.59] Well, that was the last time I saw my mama
[02:08.85] That night I left that rickety shack
[02:11.64] The welfare people came and took the baby
[02:13.81] Mama died and I ain't been back
[02:29.31] 
[02:16.44] But the wheels of fate had started to turn
[02:19.16] And for me there was no way out
[02:21.66] And it wasn't very long 'til I knew exactly
[02:24.16] What my mama been talkin' about
[02:26.60] I knew what I had to do
[02:28.86] And I made myself this solemn vow
[02:31.91] That I's gonna be a lady someday
[02:34.49] Though I don't know when or how
[02:49.99] 
[02:36.76] But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
[02:39.49] With my head hung down in shame
[02:41.57] You know I might have been born just plain white trash
[02:44.62] But Fancy was my name
[02:55.12] 
[02:46.62] She said "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"
[02:51.87] She said "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"
[03:21.37] 
[02:59.66] It wasn't long after a benevolent man took me in off the streets
[03:04.94] One week later I was pourin' his tea in a five room hotel suite
[03:09.96] I charmed a king, a congressman and an occasional aristocrat
[03:14.51] And then I got me a Georgia mansion
[03:16.76] And an elegant New York townhouse flat
[03:18.98] And I ain't done bad
[03:28.98] 
[03:29.96] Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous hypocrits
[03:33.15] That would call me bad
[03:35.03] And criticize mama for turning me out no matter how little we had
[03:39.94] But though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin' for nigh on fifteen years
[03:44.70] Well I can still hear the desperation in my poor mama's voice
[03:48.48] Ringin' in my ears
[03:57.48] 
[03:50.24] "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"
[03:55.29] Oh, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"
[03:59.63] Lord, forgive me for what I do
[04:02.68] But if you want out well it's up to you
[04:05.01] Now don't let me down hun your mama's gonna move you uptown"
[04:35.01] 
[04:12.16] Oh and I guess she did
